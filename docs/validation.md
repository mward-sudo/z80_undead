# CPU Architecture Validation

## Test Coverage

The validation suite now includes:

### Core CPU Tests
- Instruction execution flow
- Flag handling
- Register operations
- Memory operations

### Decoder Tests
- Prefix handling
- Instruction decoding
- State management
- Error handling

### Timing Tests
- Instruction cycles
- Memory access timing
- Event timing
- RetroArch compatibility

### Event System Tests
- Interrupt handling
- Timer events
- Event ordering
- Timing accuracy

## Success Criteria

1. All tests must pass with no failures
2. Timing accuracy within 1 T-state
3. Full compatibility with RetroArch timing requirements
4. Correct handling of all Z80 instruction prefixes
5. Accurate event processing and interrupt timing

## Test Coverage Metrics

Use cargo-tarpaulin to generate coverage reports:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

Current coverage targets:
- Core CPU: 95%
- Decoder: 90%
- Timing: 95%
- Event System: 90%

## Dependencies

This validation suite depends on the following issues being completed:
- #3: CPU Core Implementation
- #4: Memory Management
- #5: Instruction Set
- #6: Timing System
- #7: Event System
- #8: RetroArch Integration
- #9: Decoder Implementation
- #10: System Interface
